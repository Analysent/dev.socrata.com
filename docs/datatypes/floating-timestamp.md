Floating timestamps represent a logical day and time without reference to any particular time zone.  No matter where they are viewed, they will be seen as being the same time.

For example, if a time is stored as 3:00pm on April 8th in Washington D.C..  That same time will show up as 3:00pm on April 8th in Seattle, WA.
