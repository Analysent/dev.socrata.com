## What is an API Endpoint?

An `endpoint` in a SODA API is simply a unique URL that represents an object or collection of objects. Every Socrata `dataset`, and even every data `record`, has its own endpoint. The endpoint is what you'll point your HTTP client at to interact with data resources.

All resources are accessed through a common base path of `/resource/` along with their `dataset identifier`. This paradigm holds true for every dataset in every SODA API.

There are two types of dataset identifiers:

* Simple Socrata datasets have a unique "4x4" identifier - eight alphanumeric characters split into two four-character phrases by a dash. For example, `644b-gaut` is the identifier for the White House Visitors: [https://explore.data.gov/resource/644b-gaut.json](https://explore.data.gov/resource/644b-gaut.json) dataset.
* Customized API Foundry endpoints have a human-readable alias that can be used as an identifier in addition to the 4x4 identifier. For example, this URL is equivalent to the one above: [https://explore.data.gov/resource/white-house-visitor-records.json](https://explore.data.gov/resource/white-house-visitor-records.json)

**Note:** The 4x4 identifiers are generated by Socrata and are unique within each data site.

The endpoint URL for any SODA API can be created via this simple rule:

<code class="url">
	<span class="transport">http://</span><span class="domain">$domain</span><span class="path">/resource/</span><span class="identifier">$dataset_identifier</span>
</code>

For example, the endpoint for the [White House Visitors Record](http://explore.data.gov/d/644b-gaut) dataset would be:

<code class="url">
	<span class="transport">http://</span><span class="domain">explore.data.gov</span><span class="path">/resource/</span><span class="identifier">644b-gaut</span>
</code>

You can also find API endpoints in the "Developers" section of Socrata-powered data sites, or under "Export" then "API" on any Socrata dataset page.

Output formats can also be selected by adding an "extension" to your API endpoints. For more details see the [Output Formats](/docs/formats/index.html) section.
