## What is a row identifier?

Socrata datasets are essentially a collection of rows. Each row can be uniquely designated by it's "row identifier", much like a drivers license number or social security number identifies an individual. For those familiar with database concepts, they essentially act the same way as [primary keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key).

## Internal Identifiers vs Publisher-Specified Identifiers

Row identifiers come in two flavors:

- Internal identifiers are auto-generated by the Socrata platform every time a new row is created.
- Publisher-specified identifiers are configured by the dataset owner and use a field of unique values within the dataset as the row identifier.

<p class="alert alert-info">Depending on what dataset you're accessing, internal row identifiers may be simple integers, or alphanumeric strings. There's no difference between the two in how you use them.</p>

## Retrieving Internal Identifiers

By default, internal metadata is not returned with requests. You can override this option by passing a `$select` parameter that includes `:*` along with your request. For example, if you wanted to get all of the fields, you could use `$select=:*,*`.

{% comment %} {% include tryit.html domain='explore.data.gov' path='/resource/644b-gaut.json' args='$select=:&#42;,&#42;' %} {% endcomment %}

Notable system fields:

- `:id` - The internal identifier for each row
- `:created_at` - An integer representing the [Unix epoch date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) at which this row was created
- `:updated_at` - An integer representing the [Unix epoch date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) at which this row was last updated

## Retrieving Rows By Their Identifiers

To use a row identifier to look up a row, simply append it to the resource endpoint for that dataset. For example, to look up row `1` from the Visitor Records dataset using its row identifier:

{% include tryit.html domain='explore.data.gov' path='/resource/644b-gaut/1.json' %}

In contrast, the [USGS Earthquakes](https://soda.demo.socrata.com/dataset/USGS-Earthquake-Reports/4tka-6guv) dataset is configured to use a publisher-specified identifier. To look up the earthquake with the ID `00388610`:

{% include tryit.html domain='soda.demo.socrata.com' path='/resource/4tka-6guv/00388610.json' %}

{% include try.html %}

## Establishing a Publisher-Specified Identifier

A publisher-specified row identifier can be established for any Socrata dataset (requires a Socrata account with Publisher/Owner permissions on the dataset). A common column to use as a row identifier is an 'ID' column with some kind of number or code that uniquely identifies that row of data. For example, the '*Inspection ID*' column of [Chicago's Food Inspections dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5) is a Publisher-specified row identifier.

### How to set a row identifier
**Step 1:** When viewing a dataset click the "About" button in the upper right which is a dark red button.

**Step 2:** In the side menu that appears click "Edit metadata" (if you do not see this link ensure you are logged in).

**Step 3:** Scroll to the subheader called "API Endpoint" and below that you can select the row identifier from the drop down menu that contains all the columns within the dataset.

**Step 4:** After selecting the appropriate column. Click "Save" at the bottom.
