## What is a row identifier?

Socrata datasets are essentially a collection of rows. Each row can be uniquely designated by it's "row identifier", much like a drivers license number or social security number identifies an individual. For those familiar with database concepts, they essentially act the same way as [primary keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key).

## Internal Identifiers vs Publisher-Specified Identifiers

Row identifiers come in two flavors:

- Internal identifiers are auto-generated by the Socrata platform every time a new row is created.
- Publisher-specified identifiers are configured by the dataset owner and use a field of unique values within the dataset as the row identifier.

## Retrieving Internal Identifiers

By default, internal metadata is not returned with requests. You can override this option by passing `$$exclude_system_fields=false` along with your request. Here's an example using the [White House Visitor Records](http://explore.data.gov/d/644b-gaut):

<a href="https://explore.data.gov/resource/644b-gaut.json?$$exclude_system_fields=false&amp;$limit=5">https://explore.data.gov/resource/644b-gaut.json?$$exclude_system_fields=false</a>

Notable system fields:

- `:id` - The internal identifier for each row
- `:created_at` - An integer representing the [Unix epoch date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) at which this row was created
- `:updated_at` - An integer representing the [Unix epoch date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) at which this row was last updated 

## Retrieving Rows By Their Identifiers

To use a row identifier to look up a row, simply append it to the resource endpoint for that dataset. For example, to look up row `1` from the Visitor Records dataset using its row identifier:

<a href="https://explore.data.gov/resource/644b-gaut/1.json">https://explore.data.gov/resource/644b-gaut/1.json</a>

In contrast, the [USGS Earthquakes](https://soda.demo.socrata.com/dataset/USGS-Earthquake-Reports/4tka-6guv) dataset is configured to use a publisher-specified identifier. To look up the earthquake with the ID `00388610`:

<a href="https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/4tka-6guv/00388610.json">https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/4tka-6guv/00388610.json</a>
