Happy New Year! Kicking off 2016 we have a small update to the documentation about [System Fields](/docs/system-fields.html) documentation, which will help you understand better how and when records in a dataset have been updated.

We're looking forward to an exciting year of watching the civic developer community continue to flourish and grow!
