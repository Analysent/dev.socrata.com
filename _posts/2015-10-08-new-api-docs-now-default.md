In the past few days, you may have noticed that when visiting API documentation for datasets, you're automatically redirected to the documentation for the [new, high-performance endpoint](/changelog/2015/04/27/new-higher-performance-apis.html) for that dataset. This was a deliberate change in order to encourage developers to use those new endpoints, now that we have 6 months of stability under our belts.

If you'd still like to access the old endpoint documentation, it's still available - just click the link at the blue box at the top of the page:
