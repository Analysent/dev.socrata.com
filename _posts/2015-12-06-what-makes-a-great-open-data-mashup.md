<p>As we progress through the <a href="http://sjopendata.challengepost.com/">Summer Jam "Open Data Mashup" Challenge</a>, I've gotten the same important question a few times: "What makes a great open data mashup?"</p>
<p>I figured the best way to answer that question was with code, so I did just that. This morning I created "<a href="http://chrismetcalf.github.io/shady-eats/">Shady Eats</a>", a fun little mashup that combines <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.sfgov.org/6a9r-agq8">San Francisco food cart permits</a> with the location of <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.sfgov.org/2zah-tuvt">city-maintained street trees</a>, so you can find someplace to relax and eat your street food in the shade.</p>
<p>Yes, its kind of silly, and it doesn't solve any pressing societal issues or otherwise expand our minds through open data. But it does exemplify what I believe is a core concept of the "mashup" idea - combining two completely unrelated datasets in a new and interesting way that helps us think about the places we live a bit differently.</p>
<p>I recorded a walk-through of the app and how I built it, which you can watch below. The code is also <a href="https://github.com/chrismetcalf/shady-eats">available on Github</a>, and you can <a href="http://chrismetcalf.github.io/shady-eats/">try it out yourself as well</a> if you're in San Francisco.</p>
