Today we've released a small, experimental feature that will allow you to discuss datasets and their APIs via an [issues forum](https://github.com/socrata/discuss/issues) we've created on GitHub. When you visit the API documentation for any dataset, [like this one](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/soda.demo.socrata.com/6yvf-kk3n), you'll be presented with a new box in the sidebar that lists open discussions about that dataset, and provides you a link where you can open a new issue to discuss a new topic.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> <em>Important Note:</em> This is an unofficial discussion forum, supported by Socrata staff and our civic developer community. Although we'll make our best efforts to answer the questions we receive, we can't guarantee a response from data publishers themselves.</p>
</div>

We're very excited about this feature and we welcome your feedback about it!
