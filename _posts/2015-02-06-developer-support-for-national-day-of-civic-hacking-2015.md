<p>The clock is ticking and the time is almost upon us! In less than five days, nearly one hundred <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> events will kick off across the United States and around the world. Socrata is excited to be participating in over two dozen of them and we’re here to help with your event no matter where you are.</p>
<p>There is still plenty of time to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1t3tTklJDlsrRWFozFWqvcQznsIGaA3pGRN6pRKN9vW4/viewform">sign up for virtual support for your event</a> if you haven’t already. We’ll be there to  assist with your final preparations, help you find local datasets, and answer any questions your developers have about the Socrata Open Data APIs.</p>
<p>If you’re at an event and you need a hand, we’re here to help! You have a number of different options for reaching us:</p>
<ol>
	<li>First step should be checking out all of the awesome resources on <a href="http://dev.socrata.com">dev.socrata.com</a>, where we have full documentation on SODA, SoQL, and how to make use of them in a variety of different programming languages and frameworks.</li>
	<li>If you’re at one of the events where we’re there in person, track down the Socrata representative at your event. If they can’t answer your question themselves, they can find someone who can.</li>
	<li>If you’d prefer to chat live with a technical expert, <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/irc.html">jump into our IRC channel</a>. We’ll be hanging out there all weekend ready to answer questions as they come up.</li>
	<li>You can also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=soda,socrata">post your question to Stack Overflow</a> using the “socrata” or “soda” tags and our team will be alerted to find an answer to your question.</li>
	<li>Looking for open datasets? Check out the <a href="http://www.opendatanetwork.com/">Open Data Network</a>, our open data search engine to discover datasets across our network of hundreds of open data sites. Hint hint, there’s also an <a href="http://labs.socrata.com.dev/docs/search.html">API available via Socrata Labs</a>.</li>
</ol>
