We're excited to announce that today, along with the release of [support for viewing documentation for private APIs while authenticated](/changelog/2015/10/27/private-api-docs.html), [dev.socrata.com](/) is also going HTTPS-only to protect your privacy.

If you encounter any issues with this change, please [let us know](/support.html), and we'll work quickly to solve them.
