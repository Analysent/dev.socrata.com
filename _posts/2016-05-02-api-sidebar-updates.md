For those of you who are used to looking up [API endpoints](/docs/endpoints.html) within the "SODA API" sidebar on Socrata data portals, good news! Recently we've changed that sidebar to display the new SODA 2.1 API endpoint, for datasets that support it, rather than the old SODA 2.0 endpoint. This will make it easier for experienced SODA developers to grab that API endpoint URL and go. 

For new users, we still recommend clicking that "API Docs" button to get detailed documentation for that dataset API to give you the best head start.
