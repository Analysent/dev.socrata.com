We've updated the code block for sample queries on [dev.socrata.com](/) with a number of new great tools to help you interact with our example queries. On every sample query block, you'll see a new toolbar on the top with buttons that perform different operations.

![New Query Tools](/img/2016-03-03-query-tools.png)

Your options include:

- ![try it](/img/2016-03-03-try-it.png) - Run the query displayed and display the output
- ![docs](/img/2016-03-03-docs.png) - Open the API docs for this dataset in a new window
- ![copy](/img/2016-03-03-copy.png) - Copy the query URL to your clipboard
- ![edit](/img/2016-03-03-edit.png) - Load this query in [Hurl.it](http://hurl.it), an awesome web tool for testing REST APIs
- ![json](/img/2016-03-03-format.png) - Change the [output format](/docs/formats) used for the sample query to JSON, CSV, XML, etc.

This new layout is also expandable, so in the future we'll be able to add features like automatic code sample generation! Enjoy, and if you have any feedback, [please let us know](/support.html).
