Continuing our effort to make it easier and easier to get started using the Socrata Open Data APIs, our API docs pages now include automatically-generated code snippets for popular programming languages and powerful data science tools. [Check it out!](/foundry/data.ct.gov/y6p2-px98).

To start, we've included snippets for jQuery, Ruby, R, and a few other languages, but we'll be adding many more in the future. Give it a try, and [let us know what you think](/support.html)!
