[Safe Software](http://www.safe.com) has partnered with Socrata to build an FME "writer" for Socrata. Using the Socrata Writer, you can easily create workflows to extract data from source systems using [Safe FME](http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-technology/), perform cleanup and transformation, and publish that data to Socrata.

For more information about the Socrata Writer for FME, see this [helpful writeup on Safe's website](http://www.safe.com/solutions/for-applications/socrata/), as well as [this demo tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5lr6qw20-s). We have also produced a [support article on how to set up a simple FME workflow for Socrata](http://support.socrata.com/entries/24459198-Setting-up-a-simple-Socrata-integration-with-FME).
