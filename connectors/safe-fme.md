[Safe Software](http://www.safe.com) has partnered with Socrata to build an FME "writer" for Socrata. Using the Socrata Writer, you can easily create workflows to extract data from source systems using [Safe FME](http://www.safe.com/fme/fme-technology/), perform cleanup and transformation, and publish that data to Socrata.

For more information about the Socrata Writer for FME, see this [helpful writeup on Safe's website](http://www.safe.com/solutions/for-applications/socrata/). We have also produced a tutorial for [how to use the FME Socrata Writer](http://dev.socrata.com/publishers/examples/fme-socrata-writer.html).
